Welcome to a fun and insightful project that brings together machine learning and recommendation systems! 🚀 In this notebook, we build a linear regression-based recommender model that considers multiple factors to predict user preferences — it’s simple, powerful, and easy to follow!

🧠 What’s Inside?
📚 A well-documented Jupyter Notebook

🎯 A clear walkthrough on building a multivariate linear regression model

🔍 Exploration of how multiple features can impact recommendations

📊 Visualizations that make learning intuitive and exciting!

💡 Why This Project?
If you’re curious about how recommender systems work, or you're getting started with machine learning, this project is for you! You'll see how multiple features like user preferences, item characteristics, and more can be combined to make smarter predictions using good old linear regression.
